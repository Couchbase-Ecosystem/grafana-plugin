# Couchbase datasource plugin for Grafana

!["Couchbase-powered dashboard"](res/dashboards.png "Example dashboard")

This is a simple community-supported Grafana datasource plugin that allows querying time series and log data from Couchbase Clusters, inclding Capella clusters.

## Installation from sources
This plugin uses [Standard Grafana DataSource Backend Plugin build process](https://grafana.com/developers/plugin-tools/tutorials/build-a-data-source-backend-plugin). Also, the `./run.sh` script in this repository is used to launch Grafana with the plugin in a Docker container and usually contains the latest build process commands.

* Clone this repository 
* In `couchbase-datasource` directory, run `yarn install && yarn build && mage -v`
* Copy `couchbase-datasource` directory into your Grafana `plugins` directory.
* Set the following environment variables (or edit grafana configuration file according to documentation):
    - "GF_PLUGINS_ALLOW_LOADING_UNSIGNED_PLUGINS=couchbase-datasource"
    - "GF_PLUGIN_APP_TLS_SKIP_VERIFY_INSECURE=true"
* Restart grafana
* Add a new datasource in configuration and configure it with your cluster information.

## Usage
The datasource supports only `SELECT` statements.
The datasource plugin provides two additional sql++ `WHERE` clause functions that inject into all submitted queries time range filtering clauses according to 
selected in Grafana UI report time range:
- `str_time_range(<fieldname>)` for filtering on RFC3339 dates
- `time_range(<fieldname>)` for filtering on millisecond timestamps

Both functions take the name of the field to be used for filtering. 
One and only one of these functions *must* be included in every query submitted through the plugin:
Examples:

```sql
select count, time_string from test where str_time_range(time_string)
select count, timestamp from test where time_range(timestamp)
```

These are pseudo-functions, references to them are replaced with a set of `WHERE` filters on provided field by the plugin before the query is sent to the cluster.


## Development instructions 
Add `datasources/couchbase.yaml` with your datasource configuration:
```yaml
apiVersion: 1
datasources:
- name: Couchbase
  type: couchbase-datasource
  access: proxy
  jsonData:
    host: <...>
    username: <...>
  secureJsonData:
    password: <...>
```

Use `./run.sh` to start grafana in docker container with following mounts:
```yaml
    volumes:
    - ./couchbase:/var/lib/grafana/plugins/couchbase
    - ./datasources:/etc/grafana/provisioning/datasources
```

Open grafana at http://localhost:3000, use `admin` as both login and password. 
You don't need to setup a new password after you login despite grafana asking you to do that -- just reload the page.

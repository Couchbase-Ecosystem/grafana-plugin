# Couchbase datasource plugin for Grafana

!["Couchbase-powered dashboard"](res/dashboards.png "Example dashboard")

This is a simple community-supported Grafana datasource plugin that allows querying time series and log data from Couchbase Clusters, inclding Capella clusters.

## Installation using Grafana cli
Run the following command to list available plugin versions using Grafana cli tool:
```shell
grafana cli --repo https://gfp.prod.cbdevx.com/plugins/ plugins list-versions couchbase-datasource
```
Replace <VERSION> with latest plugin version from the output of the previous command and run the following command to install the plugin:
```shell
grafana cli --repo https://gfp.prod.cbdevx.com/plugins/ plugins install couchbase-datasource <VERSION>
```

## Installation from the pre-built zip archive (Deprecated, please use other methods)
We provide pre-build zip archives with plugin releases by running CI on version tags in this repository. The latest release can be downloaded from the "[Releases](https://github.com/Couchbase-Ecosystem/grafana-plugin/releases)" section. Please refer to [Grafana Documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/plugin-management/#install-a-plugin-from-a-zip-file) for instructions on installing Grafana plugins from zip files.

## Installation from sources
This plugin uses [Standard Grafana DataSource Backend Plugin build process](https://grafana.com/developers/plugin-tools/tutorials/build-a-data-source-backend-plugin). Also, the `./run.sh` script in this repository is used to launch Grafana with the plugin in a Docker container and usually contains the latest build process commands.

* Clone this repository 
* In `couchbase-datasource` directory, run `yarn install && yarn build && mage -v`
* Copy `couchbase-datasource` directory into your Grafana `plugins` directory.
* Set the following environment variables (or edit grafana configuration file according to documentation):
    - "GF_PLUGINS_ALLOW_LOADING_UNSIGNED_PLUGINS=couchbase-datasource"
    - "GF_PLUGIN_APP_TLS_SKIP_VERIFY_INSECURE=true"
* Restart grafana
* Add a new datasource in configuration and configure it with your cluster information.

## Usage
* Note: all datasource queries made from Grafana MUST include one and only one `*_time_range` function that will be replaced by the datasource plugin with a proper SQL++ time limit clause.
* Note: Only `SELECT` statements are supported.

Grafana couchbase datasources can be used both in dashboards and Explore sections to perform time-series data and aggregation queries against a Couchbase clusters. 

The plugin provides two additional sql++ `WHERE` clause functions that inject into all submitted queries time range filtering clauses according to a selected in Grafana UI report time range:
- `str_time_range(<time_string_field>)` for filtering on RFC3339 dates
- `time_range(<timestamp_field>)` for filtering on millisecond timestamps

Both functions take the name of the field to be used for filtering. 
[One and only one of these functions *must* be included in every query submitted through the plugin.](https://github.com/Couchbase-Ecosystem/grafana-plugin/issues/6)
These are pseudo-functions, references to them are replaced with a set of WHERE filters on provided field by the plugin before the query is sent to the cluster.
* Note: all queries MUST add the field used for time range filtering into their `SELECT` field list.

### Example Queries:
* This Grafana query: 
    ```sql
    select event_count, time_string_field from test where str_time_range(time_string_field)
    ```
    Will be transformed into the following SQL++ query, in which `<DT_MIN>` and `<DT_MAX>` represent date and time range selected in the Grafana UI:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM (
        select event_count, time_string_field from test where
            STR_TO_MILLIS(time_string_field) > STR_TO_MILLIS('<DT_MIN>')
            AND STR_TO_MILLIS(time_string_field) <= STR_TO_MILLIS('<DT_MAX>')
    ) as data ORDER BY STR_TO_MILLIS(data.time_string_field) ASC
    ```
* This Grafana query: 
    ```sql
    select event_count, timestamp_field from test where time_range(timestamp_field)
    ```
    Will be transformed into the following SQL++ query:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM (
        select event_count, timestamp_field from test where
            TO_NUMBER(timestamp_field) > STR_TO_MILLIS('<DT_MIN>')
            AND TO_NUMBER(timestamp_field) <= STR_TO_MILLIS('<DT_MAX>')
    ) as data ORDER BY TO_NUMBER(data.timestamp_field) ASC
    ```
  
  

## Development instructions 
Add `datasources/couchbase.yaml` with your datasource configuration:
```yaml
apiVersion: 1
datasources:
- name: Couchbase
  type: couchbase-datasource
  access: proxy
  jsonData:
    host: <...>
    username: <...>
  secureJsonData:
    password: <...>
```

Use `./run.sh` to start grafana in docker container with following mounts:
```yaml
    volumes:
    - ./couchbase:/var/lib/grafana/plugins/couchbase
    - ./datasources:/etc/grafana/provisioning/datasources
```

Open grafana at http://localhost:3000, use `admin` as both login and password. 
You don't need to setup a new password after you login despite grafana asking you to do that -- just reload the page.
